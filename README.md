# TriviaGame

The challenge of this assignment was to use jQuery to create a timed trivia game with 30 seconds on the clock, featuring randomized questions with a random order. The questions are from the 00-01 era. You can find the source of those questions [here](http://www.funtrivia.com/en/Sports/Philadelphia-76ers-2838.html).
