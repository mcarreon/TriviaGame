# TriviaGame

This is my entry for the Trivia Game assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at UCLA Extension. It was made with jQuery, and some bootstrap. Timed trivia game with 30 seconds on the clock, randomized questions with randomized order of answers. A bit dated, since I used questions about 00-01 eraish. You can find the source of those questions [here](http://www.funtrivia.com/en/Sports/Philadelphia-76ers-2838.html).

Philadelphia 76ers themed cause who doesn't trust The Process?
